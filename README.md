The Student Counselling Portal is a comprehensive digital platform designed to provide an integrated solution for addressing various challenges faced by students in educational institutions. These challenges primarily include academic concerns, mental health issues, etc.. The portal aims to bridge the gap between students, counsellors, and administrators by streamlining communication and offering tailored features to each user role.

The primary objective of the portal is to create a structured environment that fosters timely support and guidance for students. It incorporates features such as appointment booking, query submission, feedback handling, and user profile management to provide an all-in-one solution. By leveraging advanced technologies and intuitive design principles, the platform ensures accessibility, ease of use, and effective resource management.

For students, the portal provides a user-friendly interface to book counselling appointments, submit issues, and share feedback. The portal includes a chatbot that further enhances the experience by offering instant responses to general queries. The platform also facilitates transparency by allowing students to view their scheduled appointments and counsellor availability.

For counsellors, the portal simplifies their workflow by organizing student appointments, queries, and feedback into a manageable format. It ensures that counsellors can focus on their primary role of guiding students without being overwhelmed by administrative tasks. Notifications and an intuitive dashboard allow counsellors to stay updated on their responsibilities.

The administrative role in the portal is critical for maintaining the system's efficiency. Administrators gain access to insightful graphical representations, such as the ratio of queries received versus resolved, categorized by gender and type. This data-driven approach aids in decision-making and continuous improvement of the counselling process.

The portal also adheres to modern web development standards, using a responsive design that ensures compatibility across various devices. The backend is powered by PHP and MySQL to handle data securely and efficiently, while the frontend employs HTML, Bootstrap CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience. The Agile Development Model ensures iterative progress, allowing for timely updates and feature enhancements based on user feedback.

In essence, the Student Counselling Portal is more than just a technical system; it is a strategic initiative to enhance student well-being, improve counsellor efficiency, and provide administrators with the tools to oversee and optimize the counselling process. By centralizing these functionalities into a single platform, the portal plays a pivotal role in fostering a supportive and inclusive educational environment.
